# Park'd - Find Parking for Less

![main-logo](main.png)
In our busy car-centric cities, finding a place to park can either be straightforward or a complete chore. How often do you actually enter a parking lot and immediately find a spot to your liking? Or do you often find yourself driving up and down, looking left and right for a good spot? What if there was a way to save you the trouble and show you an open spot directly? 

Introducing Park’d, an application that aims to provide a solution to a bothersome daily chore by clearly showing open spaces to drivers, and providing directions to reach them. Park’d allows users to view every available parking space at participating parking lots in real time, while providing live navigation directions to the space of their choice.
