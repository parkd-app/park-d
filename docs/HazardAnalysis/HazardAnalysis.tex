\section{Introduction}

This document is the hazard analysis of Park'd. A hazard is a property or
condition in the system together with a condition in the environment that has
the potential to cause harm or damage = loss (From Nancy Leveson's work).

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The scope of the document is to identify the causes, effects, solutions, and new
requirements for possible hazards within the system boundaries.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system boundary and components consists of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Camera
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An external hardware that captures the video and images of parking
        lots and transmits this information as input for our machine-learning
        model
    \end{itemize}
    \item Park-d web application Band-end server system
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Communication System (Communication protocol library for different
        system components)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A system responsible for the communication of the different
            components of the application.(Communicating through HTTP call or
            RPC call)
            \item A system responsible for recovery when a communication failure
            occurs.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Driver Navigation System
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A system Provides the user with the navigation information for our
        application when a user arrives at the parking lot
    \end{itemize}
    \item Administrative Map System
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A system specifically designed for parking lot owners to allow
        them to upload the physical layout of their parking lot
    \end{itemize}
    \item Machine-Learning Model
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This system serves to analyze the real-time video data of the
        parking lot and outputs vacant parking spot information upon user
        request.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Database Storage System
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The data storage system stores the necessary user information and
        parking lot information for our backend services
    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cloud server
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The cloud server provides the ability to host our services
        remotely, load balancing, and take web requests from users.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Local machine
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The local machine including a cellphone or laptop allows user to
        check parking lot information and sending requests to our services. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Critical Assumptions}
There are no critical assumptions being made.
