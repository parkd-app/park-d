\section{Introduction}

This document is the hazard analysis of Park'd. A hazard is a property or
condition in the system together with a condition in the environment that has
the potential to cause harm or damage = loss (From Nancy Leveson's work).

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\textcolor{red}{The scope of the system encompassed by this hazard analysis of the Park'd application. Hazards imposed by outer environment and society are beyond the scope of this document.}

\textcolor{red}{This document identifies hazards including security, feature authorization, user authentication, input correctness, and error handling as well as discusses the plans for hazard mitigation, and safety and security requirements that arise from the analysis of these hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system boundary and components consists of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Camera
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An external hardware that captures the video and images of parking
        lots and transmits this information as input for our machine-learning
        model
    \end{itemize}
    \item Park-d web application Band-end server system
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Communication System (Communication protocol library for different
        system components)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A system responsible for the communication of the different
            components of the application. (Communicating through HTTP call or
            RPC call)
            \item A system responsible for recovery when a communication failure
            occurs.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Driver Navigation System
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A system Provides the user with the navigation information for our
        application when a user arrives at the parking lot
    \end{itemize}
    \item Administrative Map System
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A system specifically designed for parking lot owners to allow
        them to upload the physical layout of their parking lot
    \end{itemize}
    \item Machine-Learning Model
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This system serves to analyze the real-time video data of the
        parking lot and outputs vacant parking spot information upon user
        request.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Database Storage System
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The data storage system stores the necessary user information and
        parking lot information for our backend services
    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cloud server
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The cloud server provides the ability to host our services
        remotely, load balancing, and take web requests from users.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Local machine
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The local machine including a cellphone or laptop allows user to
        check parking lot information and sending requests to our services. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Critical Assumptions}
There are no critical assumptions being made.

\subsubsection{Audit Requirements}
\noindent \emph{N/A}

\subsubsection{Immunity Requirements}
\noindent \emph{N/A}

\section{Roadmap}
\textcolor{red}{Of the new requirements listed on this document, SR1-SR3 and SR8-SR14 were all successfully implemented in Revision 1. SR4, SR5, SR6, and SR7 are all slated for a future revision, after the Capstone Expo. Of these, SR5 is considered the highest priority, to prevent lost progress. These requirements are related to contingencies regarding unreliable connections, and are considered of lower priority relative to others which are related to main functionality.}
%From the new safety and security requirements discovered, they are all
%reasonable and can be implemented within the project time frame. SR1-13 are
%expected to be implemented by Revision 1.
