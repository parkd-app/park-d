\section{Project Drivers}
This section discusses the purpose behind the project, \progname, and identifies
the stakeholders of project.

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The following provides insight on the problem to be solved and the goals of the
project.

\subsubsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}
The project, \progname, aims to provide a solution to a bothersome daily chore,
finding parking spaces, by prompting drivers of open parking spaces and
navigating the drivers to them. This project rose from the difficulty to find
parking spaces in \term{McMaster} University as there are multiple parking lots
scattered within and outside of the main campus and there is no way of knowing
which lots are full upon arrival. Users of \progname \space will be able to view
all the available parking spaces at a parking lot, select a parking space, and
be directed to the parking space in real time based on the shortest path.

\subsubsection{Goals of the Project}
The main goal for \progname \space is to reduce the amount of time drivers takes
to find a parking space. This becomes advantageous as drivers would be able to
spend their time on more meaningful things and lessen the frustration in doing
such a tedious task.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
For this project, there are a variety of different stakeholders. 

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client of this project is the instructor of SFWRENG 4G06A/B, Dr. Spencer
Smith, and the teaching assistant (TA) of caPstOneGroup, Christopher William
Schankula. As the clients, they will provide instructions on what deliverables
need to be completed, offer assistance wherever possible, and evaluate the
degree to which the project meets the requirements outlined in the \term{SRS}.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers of this project are the individuals who are interested in looking
for an open parking space in Ontario. The project targets mainly licensed
Ontario drivers of all ages, however, it is available for the general public to
access and use.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
The developers of \progname, caPstOneGroup, are considered stakeholders of the
project as their knowledge and skills necessary for the development of the
project and they are interested in the success of the project. In addition,
parking lot owners and managers are also stakeholders as they need to give
permission to setup cameras or sensors on their property and would want
customers to spend less time in parking lots when they can be shopping, and
reduce the amount of collisions, traffic, and arguments that may occur.


\subsubsection{The Hands-On Users of the Product}
The hands-on users of the product can be defined into two groups, Ontario
licensed drivers and the parking lot owners/managers. Firstly, Ontario licensed
drivers would be the main users of the application as they are the ones actively
using the application to find empty parking spaces and being navigated to them.
The drivers must be capable of navigating to the website, comprehend directions
written and spoken in English, and know the basic operations of a computer and
mobile device, like selecting and dragging. As well, they must recognize Ontario
road signs and symbols and realize that the application is to be considered as a
guide and the drivers must still abide to all laws of the road, including being
hands free on the road and staying within the speed limits. The next group of
people are parking lot owners and managers. They would be the ones responsible
for installing cameras in their parking lots and maintain the parking layout.
Parking lot owners/managers must be able to navigate to the website, understand
English instructions, and know the basic operations of a computer including but
not limited to selecting and dragging.

\item The driver wishes to start the system.
\refstepcounter{funcreqnum}
\begin{enumerate}[{FR}\thefuncreqnum.] 
    \item The system must prompt the driver to turn on the driver's location
    data.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Location data is required to navigate the driver from
    their current position to their desired parking space in the parking lot.
\end{enumerate}
\refstepcounter{funcreqnum}
\begin{enumerate}[{FR}\thefuncreqnum.] 
    \item The system must present the driver with a map of their surroundings,
    \textcolor{red}{if they have allowed location access}.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Upon start-up, the system presenting the map of the
    driver's surroundings will help the driver orient themselves in their
    current location.
\end{enumerate}
\color{red}{
\refstepcounter{funcreqnum}
\begin{enumerate}[{FR}\thefuncreqnum.] 
    \item The system shall disable the navigation component if the driver
    doesn't provide permission.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Not all drivers wish to provide permission or use the
    navigation component.
\end{enumerate}
}

\begin{enumerate}[{BE}\thebusinesseventnum.] 
\item The driver wishes to find an open parking spot.
\refstepcounter{funcreqnum}
\begin{enumerate}[{FR}\thefuncreqnum.] 
    \item The system shall use parking lot camera footage and sensors to survey
    the parking lot. \label{poc1}\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} To determine available spaces in the parking lot, camera
    footage of the parking lot and sensor information need to be collected for
    the parking spaces.
\end{enumerate}
\refstepcounter{funcreqnum}
\begin{enumerate}[{FR}\thefuncreqnum.]

    detected vehicle.\\
    S = [(x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4)] be an array of 4 tuples with each
    tuple represent the coordinates of a parking space annotation from top left
    corner to bottom right corner in counter-clock wise direction\\
    And A be a set of S\\

    \item The system shall allow the driver to select between using available
    normal, accessibility and reserved parking spaces, \textcolor{red}{with
    confirmation of authorization for the latter two}.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} The driver should be able to view and select between all
    possible types of parking spaces if they are authorized. For example, a
    driver with a wheelchair would need to see accessible parking spaces,
    whereas, an able-bodied driver would only need to use normal parking spaces
    to avoid parking in an accessible or reserved parking space.
\end{enumerate}
\refstepcounter{funcreqnum}
\begin{enumerate}[{FR}\thefuncreqnum.] 
    \item The system by default must \textcolor{red}{only allow selections for
    normal, non-reserved parking spaces, if authorization is not
    confirmed.}\\%display only normal, non-reserved parking spaces.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Most drivers will not be authorized to use accessible
    parking spaces or reserved parking spaces, such as those for public transit
    vehicles. Without any other input, the system should allow only the spaces
    that the most drivers can use.

        does not wish or is not able to select a specific parking space.
        \label{poc3}\\
        \textbf{Rationale:} Providing the input to select a specific parking
        space may be difficult on small displays because of the relative size
        difference between a parking lot and a space.\\

\section{Priority Requirements}
\label{priorityreqs}
High priority requirements are identified here, as well as requirements that are
unlikely to change.

\subsection{Requirements for the Proof of Concept}
\textbf{November 7:} The following requirements will need to be met at least one
week before the proof of concept demonstrations begin, from November 14-25. The
proof of concept plan can be found within the
\href{https://github.com/parkd-app/park-d/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}
{Development Plan}. This is to allow time for debugging and polish. These
requirements are fundamental to the basic function of the system.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperref[poc1]{BE2FR4}: The system must have access to useable
    parking area footage.
    \item \hyperref[poc2]{BE2FR6}: The system must be able to process footage to
    construct a valid parking space.
    \item \hyperref[poc3]{BE4FR13}: The system will be demonstrated with a
    single parking space.
    \item \hyperref[poc4]{BE7FR24}: The system must recognize and relay to the
    driver when they have arrived to the space.
    \item \hyperref[poc5]{BE7FR25}: The system must mark the space as full once
    a vehicle has entered it.
    \item \hyperref[pocnf1]{LF1}: The user interface should not need to be
    simplified over time.
    \item \hyperref[pocnf2]{UH3}: With only basic functionality, minimal
    instruction should be needed.
    \item \hyperref[pocnf3]{UH4}: We should not introduce any symbols that would
    be unfamiliar to the driver.
    \item \hyperref[pocnf4]{OE1}: The system will be developed for drivers.
    \item \hyperref[pocnf5]{SR1}: The video feed should never be accessible from
    the front-end, because it is processed by the back-end.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirements for Full Revisions}
\textbf{January 31:} All other requirements set out in this document are to be
met two weeks before the Revision 0 demonstration, which will occur between
February 6-17. The additional margin is because extensive debugging and testing
will likely be needed at this stage. At this time, the team will also begin to
consider the addition of further requirements to meet our stretch goals.

\textbf{March 13:} Revision 1 will likely include the addition of some stretch
goals, for which requirements will be added to this document. Those requirements
will need to be fulfilled at least one week prior to the Revision 1
demonstrations, on March 20-31.

\subsection{Requirements Unlikely to Change}
\textcolor{red}{\st{Non-functional requirements relating to the user experience
are unlikely to change because they do not rely on any specific software or
hardware limitations. Instead, they specify how we will make some design
decisions on the front-end to benefit drivers and administrators. }}

\textcolor{red}{\st{Requirements relating to the law such as parking in disabled
parking spaces are unlikely to change because these laws are well established
and unlikely to change. It would be irresponsible to release an application that
recommends breaking the law and risking a ticket or a tow.}}

\textcolor{red}{All requirements except for FR20, FR26, AND MA1 are unlikely to
change.\\
FR20: The system might be changed to automatically redirect the user to another
spot if it is close enough to the original spot selected.\\
FR26: Rather than prompting the user for feedback, the system may include
another method for users voluntarily offer feedback as it may become annoying
for the users to get a prompt after every session.\\
MA1: As the system scales and expands in the future, the maintenance procedure
may have to change to support more features and users.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Project Issues
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Project Issues}
Some threats or potential issues that may arise during development are listed
here.
\subsection{Open Issues}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item There are many laws regarding the use of smartphones when operating a
    vehicle. \textcolor{red}{Distracted driving laws in Ontario can be found}
    \href{https://www.ontario.ca/page/distracted-driving}{here}. We must make
    sure that our application complies with any laws that may apply as well as
    allow drivers to interact with our application in a way that puts safety and
    the law first. \textcolor{red}{In Ontario, this means the driver cannot
    interact with their mobile device by touch unless safely stopped out of
    traffic. When viewing their device, it must be securely mounted. This means
    our app must not prompt the driver for inputs while driving, such that usage
    cannot continue unless that input is provided.}
    
    \item We plan to use the Global Positioning System location of the driver's
    phone to track them around the parking lot. This will help us guide them to
    an available parking spot. However, the accuracy of \term{GPS} may not be
    high enough to consistently track the driver's location around a parking
    lot.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ParKam App\\
    ParKam is an application that is very similar to what we are trying to
    develop. They also use cameras to detect parking spots and navigate users to
    available spots. Although they have not entered the North American market,
    they seem to be doing pretty well in other countries such as Australia,
    Brazil, Dubai, the Netherlands, and Israel where they are based. We also
    could not find any videos of the app working so we could not judge how well
    their solution works.
    
    \item Spot Sensor\\
    From personal experience, some indoor or underground parking lots in Toronto
    have sensors above each parking spot. It uses some sort of ultrasonic sensor
    to detect if a car is occupying the spot. If the spot is empty, a light on
    the sensor turns green and if the spot is occupied, the light turns red.
    This solution is pretty good as you can quite easily spot the green light
    and see which area the empty spot is. However, there are several issues with
    this solution. One main problem is that it requires installing hardware at
    every parking spot. Furthermore, the light does not tell you exactly how to
    get to the parking spot.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{New Problems}
These are problems that may be caused by Park'd itself.
\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The Park'd app should relieve traffic around parking lots as less people would
be driving around a parking lot looking for empty spots. This should allow more
cars to quickly get to a parking spot and less cars roaming the parking lot.
This would also make the parking lots safer for pedestrian since less traffic
would reduce the chance for accidents.

\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
N/A

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
A major potential user problem would be users getting distracted when using the
app in their car. Users getting distracted when using our application could
cause accidents which would be unacceptable. We have to make sure that safety is
our number one priority when developing the app. Users should be able to use the
app hands-free and without distractions when they are operating a vehicle.
\textcolor{red}{As per previously stated Ontario law, there should be no need
for continuous input while the user is driving.}

\subsection{Risks}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inadequate time management is a key risk to the development of our
    app. While working on creating the app, our team is also busy working and
    studying for other courses throughout the year. It is important for the team
    to keep in mind that we have other responsibilities to take care of besides
    this project. We often set very big goals for ourselves and we need to keep
    each other in check to make sure we are being realistic with our goals and
    work. We only have two terms to complete this project, which may seem like a
    lot of time now but it will pass by quickly and we have to stay on top of
    our plans.
    
    \item There are some technologies that are new for most or all of our team
    members. One of these technologies is machine vision and machine learning.
    The team will have to learn about these technologies as we develop our
    project. This could pose risks of obstructions and road blocks in our
    development which could take more time than usual to figure out as we are
    learning as we go.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Costs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Monetary Costs: \\
    Some of the technologies we plan to use, such as hosting services, have free
    versions or credit that are available for University students. Cameras would
    be useful to capture our own footage of scale models or real parking lots
    for training and testing purposes. This can be done for free with any
    smartphone or webcam any team member owns. We can also use a RaspberryPi and
    camera module to have a standalone system that can record footage and even
    send a live feed. A RaspberryPi and camera module would cost around \$50
    dollars.
    
    \item Time Costs: \\
    Time costs are difficult to estimate as each requirement or feature will
    take different amounts of time to complete. Unforeseen issues may also
    affect the duration to develop certain features. A rough estimate based on
    our six business events would be 1.5 months, assuming an average of one week
    of development per business event to get our application to a state that can
    be considered a Minimum Viable Product. On top of this, we would still have
    to complete testing, documentation, and improving our existing features
    before moving on to stretch goals. 
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
This section specifies what users may need to do to prepare to use the
application, and what resources will be made available.
\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}
The following is a list of documentation that will be available to the user:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User manual \\
    The User manual in the About page explains the user-facing features of the
    application and how to use it to find a parking spot. %This can be organized
    by the business events outlined in Section 3.2. 
    %\item Installation manual \\
    %The Installation manual explains how the user can install the application
    %onto their device in easy-to-follow steps.
\end{enumerate}
These documents will be updated and modified as the team sees fit throughout the
development process. 
\subsubsection{Training Requirements}
No specific training will be required for users to utilize our application. The
contents in the user manual and installation manual should be sufficient to get
users to start using our application.
\subsection{Waiting Room}
Refer to Section 3 of the Problem Statement document for Stretch Goals that the
team plans to develop if time allows.

\subsection{Reflection}

\label{reflection}
\subsubsection{Presentation Skills}
One of the skills that our team will collectively need to acquire is our
presentation skills. Presenting in a professional setting is a nerve-wracking
task, especially while being evaluated on our performance. For the team members
that are pursuing the management program, this skill has been developed to a
greater extent, but there is still room for improvement, since the audience for
management projects vary vastly from the audience for the capstone project, as
we will be presenting to teaching assistants, the professor, onlookers at the
EXPO competition and even prospect students if chosen to present at May @ Mac.
\\
\\
\noindent \textbf{Learning Approaches}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Improvisational Skills: It is highly likely that something will go
    wrong or important content was missed during the presentation. At this
    moment, team members will have to go off the script to keep the show going
    and to cover all the material required. 
    \item Meditation Skills: When things do go wrong, remaining calm will allow
    you to avoid voicing incoherent and irrelevant ideas, and derailing the
    focus of other team members.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Almen: I believe that the approach of mastering improvisational skills
    would be beneficial to me. I like keeping things very structured, and that
    includes what is being said during a presentation. It provides a sense of
    security for me knowing what is happening next. However, knowing the nature
    of in-person presentations, there are a lot of factors that can affect the
    overall structure including members forgetting their part, members are
    unable to make it to the presentation due to unforeseen circumstances, etc.
    On top of that, questions will be brought up that may not have been planned
    for and it is up to us to come up with an appropriate response to them. In
    the event that that happens, I will have to think on my toes which is
    normally something that I am unprepared for. This is why I chose working on
    improvisational skills as a way to work on my presentation skills.
    \item Albert: My history with class presentations have always been on the
    more theatrical side. Messing things up could be played for laughs and no
    one would be thinking lesser. But, with a formal presentation, it isn't an
    option. I should improve my skills through mediation, so that mess ups don't
    ruin the professional tone. Maybe it could be done so well that it's like it
    was all part of the plan.
    \item David: My priority would be improving my improvisational skills,
    because sometimes I have issues thinking on the spot about what I need to
    say next. Nerves is definitely an issue as well but my strategy of plowing
    through any slip-ups I make has worked well. The consequences of not knowing
    what to say or saying the wrong thing are more serious.
    \item Gary:I believe I can improve my presentation skills through mastering
    improvisational skills as it almost always happen in a presentation where
    you get interrupted by a question or some member forget their parts, and you
    have to improvise in the crunch time to make sure the presentation continues
    smoothly.
    \item Jonathan: I have always been a firm believer that the presentation is
    sometimes just as important as the product. Many people buy average products
    just from the presentation and how it is marketed. One common example are
    restaurants and cafes that serve average food but the plating is pretty or
    the ambiance is nice. In the context of our project, a solid and smooth
    presentation will give a better impression to our audience and in turn, they
    will have a better impression of the product itself. To better guarantee a
    solid presentation, strong improvisational skills are necessary to smooth
    out any bumps that will occur. Being stuck in a presentation because of some
    issue is the worst thing that can happen and having good improvisational
    skills can help alleviate that problem.
    \item Kabishan: I believe that I can improve my presentation skills by
    mastering meditation skills. In doing so, not only will I be an asset to the
    presentation, but I will also improve my ability to cope with stressful
    situations outside of the capstone project. I often find myself unable to
    think coherently or cohesively during stressful situations, so taking this
    approach will allow me to calm down and think more rationally.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Time Management}
Another skill our team will need to collectively acquire is time management.
With such a large scale project and course, there are many deliverables that
need to be completed by a certain deadlines and a lot of work needed to be done.
On top of the other assignments and midterms that we have with other courses, it
is crucial to be able to manage our time wisely to ensure that we output
something we are proud of and that is well thought out. \\[.1in]
\noindent \textbf{Learning Approaches}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start sooner rather than later. More often than not, the amount of
    work that needs to be done is often overlooked until we actuall y start
    working on it. In times where we may think that the task would be easy and
    start later would be the times where we would be rushing at the end to
    complete it the most. By starting early, we would know exactly what needs to
    be done, ask any questions that we have about topics we are unclear about,
    and have more time to complete the work for this project as well as others. 
    \item Determine our priorities and keeping track of them and their
    deadlines. With all the capstone deliverables and other course work that we
    have, it can be overwhelming to juggle between the different deadlines,
    unsure of which one to start or complete first. By defining our priorities,
    it can give us a direction as to what needs to be done and what goals need
    to be accomplished. Furthermore, using software like Google Calendar or
    Notion can help us stay on track with deadlines and also provide reminders
    on when upcoming due dates are.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Almen: I believe the best approach would be to start sooner. With
    everyone's different course work and schedules, knowing exactly what we need
    to do will provide us ample time to accommodate for course work and
    unexpected work items.
    \item Albert: I've always been a start sooner and get small bits of work
    done and have time at the end to change all that work, but, with a group of
    6, we may have to start before the previous deliverable is finished to fit
    in enough time for sync ups in everyone's schedule.
    \item David: Starting sooner is best so I can avoid other deadlines.
    Scheduling ahead of time is unreliable because we can't predict how long
    each task will actually take. There will also be sufficient time to fix any
    issues that crop up.
    \item Gary: I would prefer to start sooner rather later so that we can find
    issues at early stage and keep ourself in the right track.
    \item Jonathan: I think that starting sooner would be the better approach as
    we would give ourselves more time to accomplish our goals as well as
    allowing larger margin of error for any problems or roadblocks that may come
    up. However, starting sooner is not always easy to do and procrastination is
    inevitable. In that sense, keeping track of our priorities and deadlines
    will be key to making sure that we complete the work that must be done
    before spending more time on aspects that can be considered a bonus.
    \item Kabishan: I believe I would benefit from pursuing both approaches in
    this regard, for starting sooner than later enables me to work through
    problems at my own pace rather than rushing through all of the work near the
    end. This would help me avoid silly mistakes and would give me ample time to
    think of new ways to approach problems. With regards to the second approach,
    it is best to prioritize my work in terms of deadlines or importance, which
    I can easily determine by using software like Outlook Calendar or GitHub
    Issues. This would also help me keep track of all of my deliverables for the
    capstone project.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Team Trust}
A skill often ignored in student groups is team trust. We all know the pain of
having someone not do their part and wait until the last minute to say something
and have everyone else scramble to get it done. It's too late to think about
what they should've done, so should build this skill now. One should trust
others enough to say "I need help I can't get this done" and have understanding.
We should aim to trust each other, not as students trying to do well, but as
individuals of team caPstOneGroup making something great. \\[.1in]
\noindent \textbf{Learning Approaches}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Collaborate on other courses.
    \item Include team building exercises in meetings.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Almen: I would prefer collaborating on other coursework with the team
    as we have a lot of assignments, it is difficult to find time to work on
    building that team trust outside working on other courses.
    \item Albert: I prefer collaborating on other courses as there's already too
    much work, and, with more work, someone is more likely to ask for help.
    \item David: Collaborative study is a fantastic way to build relationships
    and team chemistry. It can be far more effective than studying alone, and it
    is a good way to get an idea of what my teammate's strengths are.
    \item Gary: Collaborating on other courses would be suitable for me to build
    team trust since there is already too much work and if we can build team
    trust while working in other courses, that would be kill two birds with one
    stone.
    \item Jonathan: I think collaborating on other courses would be a great way
    to build team trust. Since we are all in the same program, we share many
    courses and can collaborate and help each other to do better in our courses.
    Also, if collaborate with each other on other courses, we could finish any
    work we have sooner and can allocate more time to develop our application.
    \item Kabishan: I believe that by pursuing team building exercises in
    meetings, I can improve this skill, for even a fun activity, such as playing
    board games, can reveal our personalities and allow us to better understand
    each other. By strengthening this facet of our relationship, we can also
    improve our trust in each other.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Front-end Development}
Web frameworks will be unfamiliar to some members of our team, so all team
members will need to familiarize themselves to make a good user interface. Even
though not everyone will be working directly on the front-end, it will be
helpful to have some knowledge while working on the back-end to help account for
any information the front-end would need. Front-end requirements will help
tailor back-end design decisions. \\
\\
\noindent \textbf{Learning approaches}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use knowledge acquired from the web development group project in
    SFWRENG 4HC3, Human-Computer Interfaces.
    \item Self-study using a online tutorials.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Almen: With experience with front-end development, I believe that the
    best approach would be to self-study using online tutorials. This way, I can
    work at my own pace and refine what skills I would need to learn.
    \item Albert: As someone with no web development experience, the resources
    from SFWRENG 4HC3 make it seem like it's simple to do, but difficult to get
    right. More effort is needed getting it to look right than to work right. 
    \item David: I have no front-end experience so both avenues will be
    necessary for me. 4HC3 requires a certain degree of self-study anyway
    because the web frameworks that will be needed are not part of the
    instructional plan.
    \item Gary: I had experience with front-end development three years ago and
    I have forgotten some of them, therefore the best approach for me is to
    review and self-study again.
    \item Jonathan: Since I already have some experience working with web
    frameworks and front-end development, I will try to learn and apply the
    knowledge from our SFWRENG 4HC3 course to apply good design practices that
    can help make our interfaces more intuitive and easy-to-use.
    \item Kabishan: I will use both approaches, where I will initially use the
    resources provided in the Human-Computer Interface course to get my bearings
    and then I will use a self-study online tutorial to seek additional
    materials. This will allow me to become a front-end developer that is more
    conscious about interface and interaction design.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Machine Learning}
Most of the team does not have experience with developing and training Machine
Learning models, which is a key aspect of our project. We have already
designated Gary to lead our development in the Machine Learning aspects but it
is important for every team member to have a basic understanding of how the
models work. This way, we would be able to better gauge the progress of the
project and set more realistic goals for ourselves. \\
\\
\noindent \textbf{Learning approaches}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Designate a time during some meetings for Gary to explain the basics
    of how to develop and train Machine Learning models.
    \item Learn individually through online videos and tutorials.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Almen: I believe that it would be best to have Gary, our machine
    learning expert, to designated time to teach us concepts regarding training
    and developing machine learning models. This is because machine learning can
    be a very daunting topic to learn and having someone who knows what is
    needed would be the best.
    \item Albert: Machine learning has always seemed intimidating and math
    heavy, so I hope Gary can break it down easier than finding info online.
    \item David: I hope that Gary will be a helpful mentor for all of us with
    his prior \term{ML} experience. On the side, individual study will also be
    important because of Gary's time constraints.
    \item Gary: I will be responsible for explaining the details for trainging
    and testing the \term{ML} model.
    \item Jonathan: I would personally do both approaches. The machine learning
    component is something that I want to focus on developing for this project
    and I would need to learn more in-depth on my own time before working with
    Gary to see how to put it all together in the context of our application.
    \item Kabishan: I find that I learn better when mentored by a domain expert,
    so I will be resorting to the option in which Gary will be explaining the
    basics of machine learning. Of course, for questions to which even Gary does
    not have the answers, I will be using the internet.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Project Deployment}
Project deployment and hosting a web service on the cloud could be hard for some
of the group members. There are configuration including domain names needs to be
set up and building docker image pipeline. This is essential for the success of
our project and proof of concept demo. \\[.1in]
\noindent \textbf{Learning approaches}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Designate a time during some meetings for Gary to explain the process
    and make sure everyone can deploy their code into production.
    \item Learn individually through online videos and tutorials on Microsoft
    Azure help centre.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Almen: For project deployment, I would try to learn through designated
    meetings conducted by Gary while supplementing the knowledge with online
    videos and tutorials as I believe it would be beneficial to learn in future
    endeavours.
    \item Albert: Like with machine learning, I hope Gary can lead a peasant
    such as myself to his level of understanding.
    \item David: I will use online videos and tutorials to brush up on my
    knowledge, while also attending any designated meetings to discuss the
    content.
    \item Gary: I will try to review the process individually through the Azure
    documentation because this is the most effective way.
    \item Jonathan: For project deployment, I would try to learn from videos and
    tutorials online as I believe it is an important skill to have for future
    projects and employment.
    \item Kabishan: Once again, I find that I learn better when being mentored
    by someone more experienced, as reading documentation can be tiresome and
    often irrelevant. As such, I shall consult Gary for learning the basics of
    project deployment and will seek alternate means to answer more advanced
    queries.
