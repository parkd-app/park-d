Since this report is heavily based on validating the test cases we had derived
in the Verification and Validation Plan, which was done well in advance of the
implementation, we found that it would be inappropriate to test our system
against these test cases if certain features were not yet implemented. Instead
of failing a test case because the feature is not yet implemented, we have opted
to mention \textcolor{blue}{Not Tested}. These features will be ready in either
Revision 1 or another revision, and can be tested then. However, if a feature
was implemented and it satisfies the test case conditions, it will be denoted
with \textcolor{OliveGreen}{PASS} and \textcolor{Red}{FAIL} otherwise.

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

In our SRS, we had discussed two applications, namely ParKam App and Spot
Sensor, that are already on the market and perform similar features to our
implementation. 

ParKam is closed source, therefore a white box comparison is impossible to
perform. In addition, it is infeasible to perform a direct feature comparison
between our solution and ParKam, because their solution is not offered in the
North American market. Attempting to use their product would entail a lengthy
application process that may or may not succeed. According to their website
(https://parkam.com) and in some of their YouTube videos, their product seems to
be much more polished, robust and feature-packed compared to our current
implementation. For example, in addition to navigation and availability, which
our solution supports, they also detect illegal parking. They also perform a
variety of edge case testing, such as not double counting parking spaces when
the outline of a parking lot is drawn twice on top of the same space.

The other application, Spot Sensor, uses ultrasonic signal sending hardware to
detect parking spaces. Since this implementation is widely used among various
parking spaces in Toronto, we can compare how well the sensor detects the
parking's availability compared to our machine learning model, which on the
other hand, is a pure software solution. Needless to say, Spot Sensor, does not
provide any other functionality, such as navigation, therefore, this solution
can only be used to evaluate our parking detection algorithm.

\section{Automated Testing}

Automated API testing is used for python back-end server and test suits were
built on postman. Using the automated testing features in Postman, each APIs
were tested as following.

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}

From the VnV plan, we targeted at least 80\% code coverage on Python code with
\href{https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.5.0/}{Coverage.py} and on UI code
with \href{https://istanbul.js.org/}{Istanbul}. We reached 100\% and 90\%
respectively.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}

The main differences are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Some functional requirements from the first version of the VnV Plan
    were not tested because the functionality they encompassed was dropped from
    the Revision 0 Demo, due to time constraints.\\
    Changes like these can be anticipated to an extent in future projects
    because group members can often approximately predict the time needed to
    implement a given feature or function. However, given the large number of
    requirements, and the possibility of unexpected issues such as code
    incompatibility, this is not always the case. Ultimately, designers can only
    guess at what will be feasible to implement by the next deadline.\\
    Therefore, there should always be some leeway in which requirements are
    tested and which ones are left for later. By highlighting which requirements
    are of high priority, and by only using such a classification sparingly, we
    can ensure the most important functionality of an application is always
    verified and validated. A hierarchy of requirements always exists, but
    writing it down can help designers prioritize and delegate tasks
    appropriately.
\end{enumerate}
